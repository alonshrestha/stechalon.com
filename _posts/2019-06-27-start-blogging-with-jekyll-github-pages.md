This is my first [blog](https://stechalon.com/){:target="_blank"} post using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"} and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofwollow"}. **Jekyll** is a markdown language used for generating a static page and **Github Pages** is the static page hosting media. I used to have tech-related blogs and [online portfolio](https://blog.alonshrestha.com.np//Portfolio-using-Github/){:target="_blank"} on WordPress named [stechalon.com](https://stechalon.com/){:target="_blank"}.

**Wordpress** can be setup with in one click which seems to be very easy for everyone. Blogging in Wordpress can be best option for those bloggers who does not have any coding knowlodge and wants their site ready in a minute. 

However, you need to pay `money` for hosting your wordpress site using custom domain. Your billing charges on wordpress hosting depends on how much `bandwidth and space` you use. When I encountered github-pages and digging more into it. I got to know that I can host my blog for `free` using custom domain.

**GitHub Pages** provides `1 GB web space with 100 GB bandwidth per month` which is enough for a blogger. Having an IT background, using WordPress for blogging knowing that there is another technology which will save my money and also, lets me be more professional towards my profession. This thing didn't satisfied me to use Wordpress for blogging anymore. 

Also, the main reason for migrating from wordpress to  gh-pages was I wanted to have my own custom design web page and use custom domain eg: [alonshrestha.com.np](https://alonshrestha.com.np){:target="_blank"}. This site (`sTechalon.com`) is the perfect example showing you using jekyll and gh-pages for hosting my blog  using custom domain for free.

You can easily `migrate` your Wordpress post to gh-pages. Just install [Jekyll Export](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"} plugin in your Wordpress site and it will download all your post in markdown format which is used by jekyll.

After migrating all the post from wordpress to gh-pages, I didn't belive the secret that `Wordpress is the king when it comes to blog and hosting`. It is not so difficult to use jekyll and gh-pages. You can also choose different theme for your blog from here:

- [jamstackthemes.dev](https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}
- [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}
- [jekyllthemes.io](https://jekyllthemes.io/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}
- [jekyll-themes.com](https://jekyll-themes.com/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}
