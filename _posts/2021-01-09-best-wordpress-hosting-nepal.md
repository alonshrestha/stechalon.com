[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/){:target="_blank"} is a free and lightweight application. This can be hosted at a low cost shared hosting plan with one-click installation. 

If you choose a good hosting company then it takes less than a minute to install WordPress and publish your first article.
 
Search on google *“web hosting in Nepal”* and you will find numbers of web hosting companies listed. Choosing one of them according to your requirements is not that difficult as you think.

In this article, I will help you to get the best and cheapest WordPress hosting according to your needs. 

Before that, you must know 

## Why is selecting the best hosting company important?

Your website security and other components rely on the hosting provider that you select. 
The following are some important factors that must be taken into consideration before selecting it.

- **Speed** - How fast is your website served?
- **Uptime** - Is your website up and running 24x7(99.9%)?
- **Security** - Is your data protected?
- **Customer Support** - Can you get technical service 24x7?

If you take these things seriously it may also help your website to rank higher on google.

On the other hand, I guess you might have heard about *"free web hosting"* then yes it is true. You can start your blogging journey with WordPress hosting at no cost.

For that, check my list of [free web hosting companies](https://stechalon.com/web-hosting-nepal#free-web-hosting){:target="_blank"} and I am sure this will help you.

## WordPress Hosting Requirements

Below are the requirements that your host must support to run WordPress for better performance.
- PHP version 7.4 or latest (must be up-gradable)
- MySQL version 5.6 or greater / MariaDB version 10.1 or greater (must be up-gradable)
- SSL(HTTPS)

Since you are here, I assume you know your website type and which plan best fits you. **For example**: *if you are a beginner it is best to go with a shared hosting plan*.

Do not worry if you have no idea about such plans. You can check here to know [What is Shared, VPS, and Dedicated hosting plan](https://stechalon.com/web-hosting-nepal#shared-hosting-for-beginners){:target="_blank"}? I really suggest you see this before moving to next.

I found the AGM web host, one of the affordable web hosting companies in Nepal.

It is an Indian based web hosting company targeted at multiple countries’ users. AGM has two branches in Nepal i.e Kathmandu and Butwal.

I have bought multiple domains and hosting plans from the AGM web host.
