![Register.com.np For Free In Nepal | stechalon.com](/static/img/posts/register-com-np-free-in-nepal/main.png)
The domain .com.np is the free thing you can add to your online property without paying any single penny in Nepal. With a personal name domain, you can brand your name or services through websites. Most of the people have a blog page or portfolio page with their self name domain. I have used my name as a domain [alonshrestha.com.np](http://alonshrestha.com.np/){:target="_blank"}for my personal and blog. 

## What Is .com.np?

In short <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.np" target="_blank">.np</a> is the country top-level <a href="http://babbaldeals.com/tag/domain" target="_blank">domain</a> in Nepal administered by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://mos.com.np/" target="_blank">Mercantile Communications Pvt. Ltd</a>. Registration of .np with a secondary level like **<a href="http://stechalon.com/register-com-np-domain-free-in-nepal" target="_blank">.com.np</a>**, **edu.np**, **org.np** can be registered by **Nepalese**, **Non-Resident Nepalese**, and even by the **foreigners** having Nepalese residential. 

If you also want to have a free domain with your name follow the procedure below.
