So, you want to host your website? I guess it's yes because you are on this page.

Not to worry, you are in the right place. Today, I will help you to find the best web hosting companies having reliability also at affordable prices in Nepal.

If you don't want to read this whole article and want a direct answer then you can choose **[Himalayan Host](https://www.himalayanhost.com/aff.php?aff=259){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}** without any doubt. 

But if you are looking for more **for example**: beginner hosting, cheapest hosting, free hosting, etc then you should definitely read this article completely. I am sure you will discover new things.

<ins>**Check this**</ins>: If you are also searching for [Best WordPress hosting in Nepal](https://stechalon.com/best-wordpress-hosting-nepal){:target="_blank"}.

Choosing a perfect web hosting service is not that difficult as you think. 

You just need to know what shape and size your website has and how much traffic(users) visits your website per day or month. What I meant here is 

- **Shape**: In which platform your website is built? (eg: JAVA, Python(Django), PHP, etc)
- **Size**: How much disk space does your site needs?
- **Traffic**: What amount of bandwidht does your website needs?  

After knowing these, your finding of the "best web hosting in Nepal" is almost done.

Web hosting services come with different plans categorized in all shape and sizes.

If you have searched or tried to buy hosting services then you should have heard about shared hosting, dedicated hosting, reseller hosting, VPS, etc.

These terms are nothing but just a hosting service categorized for you according to your website types.

Let me explain these terms in short. If you know what these terms mean then you can [skip this part](https://stechalon.com/web-hosting-nepal#reseller-hosting).

### Shared Hosting (For Beginners)
In shared hosting, single server resources are being shared with multiple users. The individual user hosting their website on this server has no idea about other users hosting their websites on the same server. Individual customers will have a limited number of resources.

I suggest you to use this kind of hosting if you have light weight website or a beginner wordpress blogger.

### VPS: Virtual Private Server (For Professional)
VPS is still similar to shared hosting with optimized performance. In this case, your website shares a server with other websites. This kind of server is partitioned into different virtualized servers. Simply to understand this kind of server is rented out and operates as independent servers from one another.

This will be best for hosting multiple websites sharing a same server. Also, good to go with the website application using many resources. 

### Dedicated Hosting (For Business)
In dedicated hosting, a single business customer has complete access and control over the server. Security and performance are more optimized and expensive than other hosting plans.

Select this plan if your website needs personal server with full resources. 
### Reseller Hosting
About reseller hosting, from the name itself, it’s clear. The reseller purchases the host’s services at a wholesale rate and then sells them to customers. This hosting is possibly a profit base plan. Now, it’s you to select the service depending upon how much budget you have and which service best fits your website.

I have hosted different types of websites and used most of the hosting services of Nepal. Read this article in-depth so that you can save money, and pick up the right web host plan.

If you have better suggestions than mentioned below companies then please let me know in the comment below.

## Where Am I Hosting My Website?

Before knowing about my website If you are not interested in the above-mentioned hosting companies and searching for free web hosting then you are going to discover more in a minute.

I want to ask you a question. Is there a way to host a website free for life? Guess what? Yes, you can. I have hosted my website free for my entire life. You will know how I did this later on this page. Just keep reading.

There is something you should know about web hosting. If you have a static website to host then forget about web hosting companies that I have mentioned.

Simply to understand, a static website is designed without using databases. The content of static pages is fixed and should be changed manually.

I have seen many people and companies having static websites hosted on expensive servers.

There are many resources like [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}, [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}, etc that let you host static websites free for a lifetime. Only you should have some basic web building(HTML) knowledge.

Besides the static website, other sites built using databases like WordPress need a hosting server and companies mentioned above to get live.

This blog page ([stechalon](https://stechalon.com){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}) is an example of a static website created from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"} and hosted in [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"} for free.

My expenses for blogging is **1k per year**. One thousand is for the domain renewal and hosting is **free for lifetime**. Isn't this cool?

You can also get a free domain extension .com.np. I have a domain with my name [alonshrestha.com.np](https://alonshrestha.com.np){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}. 

If you want .com.np domain for free check [how to register .com.np domain for free in Nepal](https://stechalon.com/register-com-np-domain-free-in-nepal){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}.

Also, I have shared my experience on migrating this website from [WordPress to GitHub Pages](https://stechalon.com/start-blogging-with-jekyll-github-pages){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"} so you can have a look. I hope this will be helpful.

## Free Web Hosting
Free hosting is only good when you want to learn Cpanel hosting or your website is not concerned with traffic and revenue.

I suggest you not to worry about saving money on hosting if you want to blog and earn revenue from the website. Hosting your website at a good company keeps you on the safe side of the road.

Having that said, there are really great and free web hosting service providers for the nonprofit and educational sectors. I have personally tried some hosting services mentioned below.

## Conclusion
There are many other web hosting companies out of which I have selected the top five for you to make easier. You can select any one of them according to your needs.

If you are a beginner or intermediate blogger then, shared hosting will be the best plan for you. Try to get a shared hosting plan having high resources. This will cover your needs.

Now you are getting more traffic to your website and started earning revenue from it I suggest you upgrade your web hosting plan from shared to more optimized hosting or VPS.

Choose a dedicated hosting plan if your online business seems to grow in a couple of months.

Whether you are searching for the cheapest, reliable, or heavy robust service you will get all these categories in the above five mention hosting companies.

Try to ignore free web hosting web service unless your website is not important for your customers.

Try not to host your static website with web hosting companies choosing different plans. Resources like Github Pages, Amazon S3, Firebase, etc provide you the same service free for a lifetime.
