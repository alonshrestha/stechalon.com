This is my first [blog](https://stechalon.com/){:target="_blank"} post using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"} and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofwollow"}. I used to have tech-related blogs and [online portfolio](https://blog.alonshrestha.com.np//Portfolio-using-Github/){:target="_blank"} on WordPress named [stechalon.com](https://stechalon.com/){:target="_blank"}. Wordpress can be setup with in one click which seems to be very easy for everyone. Blogging in Wordpress can be best option for those bloggers who does not have any coding knowlodge and wants their site ready in a minute. 

However, you need to pay money for hosting your wordpress site using custom domain. Your billing charges on wordpress hosting depends on how much bandwidth and space you use. When I encountered github-pages and digging more into it. I got to know that I can host my blog for free using custom domain.

GitHub Pages provides 1 GB web space with 100 GB bandwidth per month which is enough for a blogger. Having an IT background, using WordPress for blogging knowing that there is another technology which will save my money and also, lets me be more professional towards my profession. This thing didn't satisfied me to use Wordpress for bloggign anymore. 

Also, the main reason for migrating from wordpress to  gh-pages was I wanted to have my own custom design web page and use my personal domain [alonshrestha.com.np](https://alonshrestha.com.np){:target="_blank"}.
Doing research on such media, I came to know about Github Pages and implementing it is the whole output I got here. Thought to share with you guys as working example.

I choose Github Pages and Jekyll for hosting my pages and didn't believe the secret that [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} is the king when it comes to blog and hosting.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} is a markdown language used for generating a static page and Github Pages is the static page hosting media. If you are posting on different media this helps you to migrate your blogs without any cost and lost in Github Pages.

## Using Github Pages
#### Pros
- [Free of cost](#)
- [Security and Reliability](#)
- [Use Custom Domain](#)
- [Custom Theme](#)
- [Fast because of a static page](#)
- [No Database](#)

#### Cons
- [Programming and GitHub knowledge are required](#)
